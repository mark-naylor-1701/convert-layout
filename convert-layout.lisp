;; Commentary:
;; System for changing the kind of layout used by a group.

;; Code:

(in-package #:convert-layout)

(export '(convert-layout))

(defgeneric convert-layout (grp &optional builder)
  (:documentation "Take the supplied group `grp' and change its layout type. The
  `builder' is a function that creates a new group."))

;; TODO: Expand to do something specific for a supplied group type. Currently,
;; the it will only toggle between a tile group and a dynamic group.

(defmethod convert-layout ((grp stumpwm:group) &optional (builder nil))
  (select-builder grp builder))

(defun select-builder (grp builder)
  "If the builder exists, return it. Otherwise, select the builder based upon
the type of the group."
  (cond
    ((functionp builder) builder)
    ((not (string= (symbol-name (type-of grp)) "TILE-GROUP")) #'stumpwm:gnew)
    (t #'stumpwm:gnew-dynamic)))
