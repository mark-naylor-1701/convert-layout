** Description
This only has the appearance of changing the layout. Actually, a new group is
created, any windows are moved to the new group, and the old group is deleted.
The new group will have the same name and number as the old group.

Creating this module had these inspirations:
  1. Questions in #stumpwm irc about changing layout types.
  2. Desire to recreate some of the behavior I used to get with xmonad.

Although this system can be used on its own, it is also designed to support the
planned xmonad-layout.
